# RL-mipt
My homeworks, that I've made during the RL-course at MIPT and classwork notebooks from "yandexdataschool/Practical_RL".
Practical assignments were completed on topics such as Crossentropy method, Value function, Q-function, DQN, Policy gradient.

Final grade (practical assignments): excellent (8).
